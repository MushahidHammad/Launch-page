# Launch-page
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project is a simple webpage with four main sections and a footer, designed to practice basic HTML and CSS layout techniques. The page features a hero text at the top, and the layout is built using flexbox. The goal of the project is to get hands-on experience with building and styling sections incrementally, without focusing on mobile responsiveness. The project structure encourages creating and styling each section step by step before moving on to the next. Once completed, the code is pushed to GitHub to share and track progress.
